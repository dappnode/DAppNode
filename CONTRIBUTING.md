# Contributing

When bringing people on as contributors we prefer that they start with an issue tagged [good first issue](https://github.com/dappnode/DNP_BIND/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

After a contributor has shown they're a good fit and have completed 1 or 2 issues labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/dappnode/DNP_BIND/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) with pull requests that have been accepted feel free of moving on to other issues. We're thrilled to see new contributors.

If you want to better understand how does the development process works, please refer to our [wiki pages](https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNode/wiki)

## Setup

In order to get the repositories setup before contributions refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNode/blob/master/README.md) file.

## Contribution Steps

1. _Find a suitable issue_

   If this is your first time look for an issue labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/dappnode/DNP_BIND/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) otherwise look for issues labeled [help wanted](https://github.com/dappnode/DNP_BIND/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) . If another issue jumps out at you please engage on the issue before starting it.

2. _Assign yourself the issue_

   Let us know you're working on it! We hate wasted labour so it's always helpful to know what our community contributors are working on.

3. _Fork and clone [DAppNode](://github.com/dappnode/DAppNode)_

   In general it's a good practice to fork into your own repository. We prefer if issues
   are addressed in a branch with the issue number in it's name.
   i.e. `29_this_is_an_issue`

4. _Make contributions_

   Make all the changes needed to address the given issue.

5. _Add testing_

   In general we aim for full test coverage. For this reason most issues completed should include full testing. If you think there should be an exception for your issue please reach out.

6. _Run previous tests_

   Make sure that the changes that you've made don't break anything! Ensure that running `npm test` and `npm eslint` doesn't throw any new and unexpected errors.

7. _Push all your work_

   At this point the issue should be addressed, new testing should be in place, and all old tests should be passing.

8. _Create a Pull Request_

   At this point you should either have a forked repository with your issue fixes and it is time to put in a PR. Make sure that your PR has something like `addresses #26` or `closes #26` The most important thing is that it has the relevant issue number referenced in the body of the PR.

9. _Make noise!_

   Get in our [Element](https://app.element.io/#/room/#DAppNode:matrix.org) and point to your new PR. Let us know if you've tackled your first, third or 90th issue with us. We'll review it and everybody will get a warm feeling of accomplishment.

10. _rinse, repeat_

    Find another issue, get more involved, make noise in our Riot, or find issues we may have missed. You've completed your first step to becoming a contributor. **You're helping to Decentralize the FUTURE**!

If you still have any further questions about contribution feel free to reach out to `@eduadiez:matrix.org`, `@yalormewn:matrix.org`, `@liondapp:matrix.org`, or just make noise in the `#DAppNode` channel on [Element](https://app.element.io/#/room/#DAppNode:matrix.org).
