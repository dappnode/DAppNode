Introduction to DAppNode
###################

What happens when you want to use a Decentralized P2P network, but securing your own nodes takes a lot of time and effort? 

You have a decentralization bottleneck at the entry point, which is where we are now in the blockchain space :-( 

1. At no point in the last 2 years has there been more than 13,000 Bitcoin nodes online and that number got as low as [5500](https://bitnodes.earn.com/dashboard/?days=730)
 
2.  MetaMask and MyEtherWallet/MyCrypto are the primary wallets used on Ethereum and most users are using these wallets’ default nodes… This is a huge centralizing force in Ethereum.

3. The people who do run their own node end up [having to spend a lot of time troubleshooting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/83a34l/centralization_in_ethereum_infura_metamask/), keeping it updated and synced without the ability to easily share their node (and efforts) with family and friends. 

DAppNode will address these issues by creating a simple, easy, self-empowering system made specifically for hosting P2P clients for DApps, Cryptocurrencies, VPNs, IPFS, and more. 

Members of the [WHG](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qvp5b3/how-ethereum-coders-hacked-back-to-rescue-dollar208-million-in-ethereum?lipi=urn%253Ali%253Apage%253Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_treasury%253B7v09na8XQqySEuI%252FPn%252Bx5Q%253D%253D) have spent countless hours developing DAppNode because they believe it to be the most important and pertinent censorship resistant tool that is to be built to help bring the decentralized world everyone wants for themselves, and their friends and family.

The Desired Final User Story
****************************

1. Vojtech has several cryptocurrencies he follows and is ready to stop using his laptop to run clients, but doesn’t want to have to pay a monthly subscription in fiat to some company he doesn’t trust with his private keys.

2. He hears about DAppNode and decides to buy the top of the line DAppNode Server preloaded from one of the many certified independent vendors (though he could buy his own server and install the software himself).

3. The DAppNode Server is delivered to his front door, and when Vojtech opens the box he finds a 2 step instruction card: First, plug in the Server. Second, go to dappnode.org/initialize

4. On this website there will be an extremely simple and short walk-thru for Vojtech to set up his credentials and choose which clients to deploy.

5. By just checking a few boxes Vojtech deployed his own VPN; his own local instance of MyCrypto.com; Ethereum, Bitcoin, Monero and Dogecoin Full nodes; a ZenCash Secure Node and DASH Master Node; he joined the IPFS Consortium and deployed a TrueBit Verifier and Livepeer node; and hosted Giveth, Swarm City, Aragon, Colony, and Decentraland Helper DApps to support these projects and to ensure that his interaction with these DApps cannot be censored and are fully trustless. 

6. Vojtech then tells his friends and family that he is the admin for his own DAppNode and he is able to give them a link that sets them up with their own credentials and access to his DAppNode, and Vojtech can deploy any other DApps that him or his friends and family want to have hosted with a couple clicks. He has become the trusted gateway to the decentralized world for his entire community. 

7. Vojtech ends up being able to pay off the cost of his DAppNode in 2 months with the profits made from his ZenCash, Swarm City, DASH and TrueBit Nodes. He also canceled his VPN and all of his Digital Ocean accounts because now he has his own server that he can host all of his services on. Without even trying, Vojtech has a couple extra hundred dollars a month because he is running DAppNode on his own personal server.


We have been working on this project mostly part time since October of last year and have a fully functional Proof of Concept, and are very close to having an MVP version that we would be proud to show off. We expect to partner with hardware manufacturers once we have a few more iterations of the software completed. 

We are developing in an invitingly open source manner and once the software is completed anyone can use their own hardware and run DAppNode on it. 

We are open to receive funding to help pay the developers working hard on the software. All funds raised are transparently accounted for using Giveth's DApp.

Benefits of DAppNode
********************

* Easy set up
* Trustless system 
* Invitingly Open Source
* Free up space on your Devices
* Great for proof of stake mining
* You can browse `.eth` domains like the normal web
* You take control of your Nodes 
* Encourages people to have their own server
* Perfect for projects that reward you for hosting, (Filecoin, Mysterium, etc)
* Can facilitate a P2P economy
* Host any P2P networking protocols
* DApp teams can develop packages their users can run 24x7 
* Never trust a hosting provider with your private keys again!
* One click node deployment (Full Nodes, DApps)
* Censorship resistance (run your own VPN) 
* 1 DAppNode can support an entire Community
* DAppNode will build communities and decrease centralization 
* DAppNode is the most important piece of infrastructure for our decencentralized future
* Considering all of the incentive structures to run nodes, most DAppNode Admins will be make a profit maintaining their own DAppNode
